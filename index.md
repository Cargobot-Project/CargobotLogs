## Introduction 
This is the Cargobot's Project Website for CS 491/2 Fall 2022/Spring 2023 semesters in Bilkent University. This is made for you track our project's progress through the semester.

## Purpose 
Cargobot aims to optimize cargo loading to the trucks in a contemporary way that our AI technology is optimizing the trailer area loading with respect to classification of different cargo types such as fragility,orientation (vertical, horizontal), priority ve weight. With our technology optimizing the trailer area will increase the transportation amount of the cargo's which will leads to less manpower cost and more profit for the cargo firms.

### Analysis

Today, a big part of the transportation industry is about loading and unloading cargo to and from trucks or containers.This usually takes a lot of manual labor and has its health and safety risks. We want to address these issues by automating the loading and unloading process with our Cargobots. You can simply put the boxes next to the truck and Cargobots can place them in the truck efficiently and in a stable position, using state-of-the-art deep learning and robotics techniques.

Furthermore, using our smart labels on boxes, you will be able to give the Cargobots information about their content such as fragility, weight, orientation or unloading priority so that they can be placed in optimal positions. In other words, with our tirelessly working Cargobots, warehouses can operate safely and with less cost.
